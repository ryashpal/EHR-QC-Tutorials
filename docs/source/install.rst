Installation
============

Follow the below steps to install EHR-QC in your computer.


Login
------

Upon login to a system and opening a terminal, the following prompt should appear, where the ``user`` is the user name and the ``hostname`` is the hostname of the system.

.. code-block:: console

   user@hostname:~$


Change directory
----------------

From the home directory which will be open by default, change to a suitable directory on your computer where the utility needs to be installed. For example, in this tutorial we have changed to ``workspace`` directory.

.. code-block:: console

   user@hostname:~$ cd workspace


Clone
-----

In the destination folder, clone the current version of EHR-QC repository from the GitHub.

.. code-block:: console

   user@hostname:~/workspace$ git clone https://github.com/ryashpal/EHRQC.git


Open EHR-QC
-----------

Open the EHR-QC directory that is downloaded from GitHub after cloning.

.. code-block:: console

   user@hostname:~/workspace$ cd EHRQC


Create virtual environment
--------------------------

Inside the EHR-QC directory, create a new Python virtual enviroment to conveniently manage all the dependencies required for the utility.

.. code-block:: console

   user@hostname:~/workspace/EHRQC$ python -m venv .venv


Activate virtual environment
----------------------------

After creating the Python virtual enviroment, activate the virtual enviroment to start using it for subsequent commands. The prompt will change with ``(.venv)`` appearing in front of it as shown below;

.. code-block:: console

   user@hostname:~/workspace/EHRQC$ source .venv/bin/activate
   (.venv) user@hostname:~/workspace/EHRQC$


Install dependencies
--------------------

Install all the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file in the newly created Python virtual environment.

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) user@hostname:~/workspace/EHRQC$ pip install -r requirements.txt


Verify
------

Verify the installation by running the following command. The expected output should contain ``EHRQC <version number>``.

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) user@hostname:~/workspace/EHRQC$ python -m EHRQC -v
   EHRQC 1.0


Docker
------

The EHR-QC is also available in Docker. Follow the instructions below to use EHR-QC as a Docker container.

Before starting, ensure the Docker engine is intalled.
`Follow the installation instructions: <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>`_

.. note::
   Please clone the repository as explained above and change to root EHR-QC directory before creating the docker container;

Build the container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Firstly, build the Dockerfile.

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) user@hostname:~/workspace/EHRQC$ docker-compose up -d

Output

.. code-block:: console

Create the container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create the docker container. It is recommended to run the container in detached mode as it enables the container to be connected from multiple terminals.

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) user@hostname:~/workspace/EHRQC$ docker-compose up -d

Output

.. code-block:: console

   [+] Running 1/1
    âœ” Container ehrqc-app-1  Started


Start the container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connect to the container to use the EHR-QC functions.

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) user@hostname:~/workspace/EHRQC$ docker exec -it <Container ID> bash


The following prompt should appear, where ``hostname`` is the hostname of the system.

.. code-block:: console

   app_user@hostname:~$

From here, the EHR-QC commands can be run as usual.

.. note::
   All the data that is saved in ``/home/app_user/data`` directory will be synced to ``~/workspace/EHRQC/data`` directory on the host machine.

.. note::
   The network conntections from the container is configured to be in ``host`` mode. This makes the container have the same network setup as the host system without a IP address of its own.
