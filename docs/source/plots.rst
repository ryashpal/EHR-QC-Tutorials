Missing Data Plots
------------------

Missing data plots generated from EHR-QC is intended to visualise the missingness in the data supplied. A single bar is generated for each of the attribute in the data supplied with gaps in the bars indicating the missing rows for that attribute. So, by looking at the gaps, the user will be able to deduce;

1. The presence of missingness in the data
2. The extent of missingness in the data
3. Patterns of the missingness in the data (random, systematic, blocks etc...)

Example 1: Missing data plot with missing values

Example 2: Missing data plot without missing values
