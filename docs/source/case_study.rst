1. Introduction
===============

In this case study, our main objective is to showcase the effectiveness of EHR-QC. We achieve this by employing the toolkit to handle EHR data comprehensively, preparing it for utilization in Machine Learning applications. To illustrate, we select a group of patients who have been diagnosed with Sepsis from the public MIMIC IV EHR database. Subsequently, we employ the EHR-QC standardization module to standardise the EHR records for these patients, converting them into the OMOP-CDM schema. Following this, we employ the EHR-QC data pre-processing module. This involves extracting information from the standardized schema, generating exploratory reports, and identifying as well as rectifying any anomalies present in the data.


2. Set-up
=========

We will be using the Dockerised EHR-QC for this case study by following the below steps;

Change directory
----------------

From the home directory which will be open by default, change to a suitable directory on your computer where the utility needs to be installed. For example, in this tutorial we have changed to ``workspace`` directory.

.. code-block:: console

   user@hostname:~$ cd workspace


Clone
-----

In the destination folder, clone the current version of EHR-QC repository from the GitHub.

.. code-block:: console

   user@hostname:~/workspace$ git clone https://github.com/ryashpal/EHRQC.git


Open EHR-QC
-----------

Open the EHR-QC directory that is downloaded from GitHub after cloning.

.. code-block:: console

   user@hostname:~/workspace$ cd EHRQC
