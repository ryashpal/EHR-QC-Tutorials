Introduction
---------------

In this case study, our main objective is to showcase the effectiveness of EHR-QC. We achieve this by employing the toolkit to handle EHR data comprehensively, preparing it for utilization in Machine Learning applications. To illustrate, we select a group of patients who have been diagnosed with Sepsis from the public MIMIC IV EHR database. Subsequently, we employ the EHR-QC standardization module to standardise the EHR records for these patients, converting them into the OMOP-CDM schema. Following this, we employ the EHR-QC data pre-processing module. This involves extracting information from the standardized schema, generating exploratory reports, and identifying as well as rectifying any anomalies present in the data.
