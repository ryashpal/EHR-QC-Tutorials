EHRQC
===================================

EHR-QC is a complete end-to-end pipeline to standardise and preprocess Electronic Health Records (EHR) for downstream integrative machine learning applications. This utility has two distinct modules;

1. Standardisation
2. Pre-processing

Both the modules can be run as a single end-to-end pipeline or individual components can be run in a standalone manner.

This utility is primarily focussed to provide a domain specific toolset for performing commmon standardisation and pre-processing tasks while handling the healthcare data. A command line interface is designed to provide an abstraction over the internal implementation details while at the same time being easy to use for anyone with basic Linux skills.
